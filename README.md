1. How did n-way selection help simplify the logic in Task 3?

It simplified the logic because it allowed for more than one outcome using multiple if-else statements. It allows you to chain statements instead of writing multiple if statements, which allows for cleaner and more efficient code.

2. What challenges did you face when nesting conditions in Task 4?
   
I had to make sure that the nested statement would only run if the first condition was true.

3. How did memory tracing help you understand control flow?
   
It helped me understand a glimpse of how variables are stored, declared, and changed.

4. What strategies did you use to test and verify your logic?
   
During my tests, I used the terminal and tested multiple inputs to see if they printed correctly.
