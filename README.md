1. How did n-way selection help simplify the logic in Task 3?

It simplified the logic because it allowed for more than one outcome using multiple if-else statements. It allows you to chain statements instead of writing multiple if statements, which allows for cleaner and more efficient code.

2. What challenges did you face when nesting conditions in Task 4?
   
I had to make sure that the nested statement would only run if the first condition was true.

3. How did memory tracing help you understand control flow?
   
It helps you understand control flow because you are learning about conditional statements as well as ways to make things easier and more readable.

4. What strategies did you use to test and verify your logic?
   
I  used the terminal and entered things to see if they printed correctly.
